"""
Works with data frame individually in order to sorting and extract data from very specific subset

A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional data structure that can store data of different types (including characters, integers,
floating point values, categorical data and more) in columns.
It is similar to a spreadsheet, a SQL table or the data.frame in R.

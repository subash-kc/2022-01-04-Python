Oh, love of mine
With a song and a wine
You're harsh and divine
Like truths and a lie

But the tale ends not here
I have nothing to fear
For my love is yell of giving and hold on

And the bright emptiness
In a room full of it
Is a cruel mistress
Whoa oh!

I feel this unrest
That nests all hollowness
For I have nowhere to go and I'm cold

And I feel so lonely yeah...
There's a better place than this
Emptiness

And I'm so lonely yeah...
There's a better place than this
Emptiness, yeah!

Tune mere jaana
Kabhi nahi jaana
Ishq mera, dard mera, haaye!

Tune mere jaana
Kabhi nahi jaana
Ishq mera, dard mera

Aashiq tera
Bhid me khoya rehta hai,
Jaane jahaan
Poocho to itna kehta hai

That I feel so lonely yeah...
There's a better place than this
Emptiness

And I'm so lonely yeah
There's a better place than this
Emptiness, yeah!
